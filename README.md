# Action-Detection-sign-Language-
 > A sign language interpretation model using LSTM neural networks and Mediapipe for gesture recognition, fostering accessibility for deaf individuals.

### **Sign Language Neural Network Model**
> Welcome to the Sign Language Neural Network Model GitHub repository! This project is a deep learning initiative focused on interpreting sign language gestures using LSTM neural networks and Mediapipe for precise image recognition.

### **Features**
* Gesture Recognition: Translate sign language gestures into specific messages.</br>
* Expandability: Easily extendable to handle additional tasks and messages through diverse actions.</br>
* Applications: Designed to assist deaf individuals in comprehending information conveyed through sign language.</br>

### **Technologies Used**</br>
- TensorFlow</br>
- OpenCV</br>
- Mediapipe</br>
- Matplotlib</br>
- Scikit-learn</br>

### **Project Structure**</br>
* Action Detection.ipynb: Contains the source code for the neural network model.</br>
* MP_DATA: Includes datasets and training data used in model development.</br>
* action.h5: Already trained weights.</br>
